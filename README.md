# Multiphone OS (Prototype)

🚀 **Multiphone OS** is a project that simulates **multiple virtual phones inside a single device**.  
Each phone has its own applications, and you can easily switch between them.  



## ✨ Features
- Create multiple virtual phones, each with different apps.  
- Switch between phones using a simple graphical interface.  
- Extendable codebase for future development (towards a full OS).
